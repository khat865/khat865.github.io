        <div class="project-title">Research on Temperature Control in Prefabricated Cavern-type Substations</div>
        <div class="project-subtitle">Provincial SRTP</div>
        <ul class="project-description">
            <li>Connect the prefabricated substation model to the cloud server using a single-chip microcontroller</li>
            <li>Construct a temperature prediction framework based on regression, and combine feature engineering with multiple modeling methods to improve the prediction accuracy</li>
            <li>Control the heat dissipation of the internal air conditioning of the auxiliary model</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="project-title">A Visual Detection Method for Surface Defects on Chips Based on The Improved YOLO11</div>
        <ul class="project-description">
            <li>Evaluated mainstream object detection models (e.g., YOLO series, Fast-RCNN) and selected YOLO11 as the baseline</li>
            <li>Incorporates a heatmap structure to enhance focus on key regions, improving detection of small and blurry targets</li>
            <li>Designs an adaptive multi-feature fusion module using parametric linear combination and soft clustering to generate an optimized fourth-channel feature, strengthening discrimination of low-contrast defects</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="project-title">Skeleton-Based Action Recognition</div>
        <ul class="project-description">
            <li>Reviews and groups skeleton-based action recognition methods into four representation-based categories, analyzing how each influences spatio-temporal modeling selection</li>
            <li>Benchmarks 19 methods on the Anubis dataset (e.g., STGCN, DeGCN, LAGCN), revealing model rankings and correlations between performance and input representation types</li>
            <li>Shows that multi-representation fusion only benefits specific actions, uncovers action-representation dependencies, and highlights limitations in fine-grained and interaction recognition</li>
        </ul>
